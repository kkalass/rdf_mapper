### Changed

- **Breaking Change**: Modified serialization API return types from `List<Triple>` to `Iterable<Triple>` for improved performance and memory efficiency:
  - `ResourceSerializer.toRdfResource()` methods now return `(RdfSubject, Iterable<Triple>)`
  - `SerializationService` methods (`value()`, `values()`, `resource()`, etc.) now return `Iterable<Triple>`
  - `SerializationContext.resource()` now returns `Iterable<Triple>`
  - `ResourceBuilder.build()` now returns `(S, Iterable<Triple>)`
  - Internal ResourceBuilder implementation optimized to avoid creating intermediate lists
- **Breaking Change**: Modified deserialization API return types from `List<Triple>` to `Iterable<Triple>`:
  - `DeserializationContext.getTriplesForSubject()` now returns `Iterable<Triple>`
  - Internal helper methods updated to work with iterables instead of lists
- **Breaking Change**: Updated RDF core dependency to `^0.9.5` (from `^0.9.4`) with corresponding API changes:
  - `RdfGraph.fromTriples()` constructor now used instead of `RdfGraph(triples: ...)`
- **Breaking Change**: Modified `SerializationContext.serialize()` return type from `(RdfTerm, Iterable<Triple>)` to `(Iterable<RdfTerm>, Iterable<Triple>)` to support multi-objects serialization
- **Breaking Change**: Simplified API by consolidating deserializer parameters - replaced multiple specific deserializer parameters with single `deserializer` parameter across:
  - `DeserializationService.require()`, `optional()`, `collect()`, `getValues()`, `getMap()` methods
  - `ResourceReader.require()`, `optional()`, `getValues()`, `getMap()` methods  
  - `ResourceBuilder.addValue()`, `addValueIfNotNull()` methods (consolidated serializer parameters similarly)
- **Breaking Change**: Enhanced `DeserializationContext.getTriplesForSubject()` with `trackRead` parameter (defaults to true)
- **Breaking Change**: Removed `readRdfList()` method from `DeserializationContext` (moved to collection infrastructure)
- **Breaking Change**: `LiteralTermDeserializer.datatype` property is now nullable (`IriTerm?` instead of `IriTerm`) - deserializers can specify a datatype to be used as fallback when exact Dart type mapping fails or target type is too broad (e.g., `Object`), or return `null` to only handle exact type matches
- Enhanced serialization context with unified `serialize()` method supporting all value types
- Enhanced collection deserialization to automatically detect and use multi-objects deserializers when available
- Updated main example to demonstrate RDF list usage with proper order preservation for book chapters
- Added `custom_collection_type_example.dart` demonstrating multiple RDF mapping strategies for the same custom collection type:
  - Strategy 1: RDF List (rdf:first/rdf:rest structure) for preserving order
  - Strategy 2: RDF Sequence (rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc.) for numbered ordering
  - Strategy 3: Multiple triples for efficient unordered collections

## [0.8.8] - 2025-07-10

### Changed

- **Breaking Change**: Modified `UnmappedTriplesSerializer.toUnmappedTriples()` method signature to include `RdfSubject subject` parameter
- **Breaking Change**: Renamed `RdfGraphMapper` to `RdfGraphUnmappedTriplesMapper` for clarity
- **Breaking Change**: Removed automatic resource mapper registration when registering `UnmappedTriplesMapper` implementations
- **Breaking Change**: Removed `includeBlankNodes` parameter from `ResourceReader.getUnmapped()` and `DeserializationService.getUnmapped()` methods
- **Breaking Change**: Modified `RdfGraphUnmappedTriplesMapper` constructor to accept optional `deep` parameter (defaults to `true`)
- Separated UnmappedTriplesMapper registration from resource mapping - UnmappedTriplesMapper now only handles unmapped triples, not resource serialization

*Note* even though there are breaking changes we stick to increasing the patch version only, because
the interfaces that were changed were added in yesterdays release and are very specific, so it is very
unlikely to really affect any users.

### Added

- Added `RdfGraphGlobalResourceMapper` and `RdfGraphLocalResourceMapper` for explicit RdfGraph resource mapping

- The `deep` property on deserializers controls whether blank nodes are recursively followed when collecting unmapped triples
- The root subject detection algorithm uses heuristics to handle common cyclic patterns while maintaining strict validation

- Enhanced error handling with detailed information about incomplete deserialization scenarios
- Enhanced existing `decodeObject()` and `decodeObjects()` methods with `CompletenessMode` support for backward-compatible lossless behavior
- Enhanced test coverage with comprehensive lossless mapping test suites covering edge cases, error scenarios, and round-trip fidelity

### Technical Details

- All lossless codecs return tuples `(T, RdfGraph)` or `(Iterable<T>, RdfGraph)` where the second element contains unmapped/remainder triples
- Lossless methods preserve complete RDF document integrity, enabling perfect round-trip serialization
- CompletenessMode integration allows gradual migration from strict to lenient deserialization behavior
- Full backward compatibility maintained - existing code continues to work without changes

## [0.7.0] - 2025-05-23

### Changed

- **Breaking Change** Simplified `ResourceBuilder` and related classes to have only `addValue`, `addValues`, `addValuesFromSource`, `addValueIfNotNull` instead of duplicating those for iri/literal/resource

## [0.6.2] - 2025-05-20

### Changed

- **Breaking Change** `childNode` -> `childResource` and related.
- **Breaking Change** `fromRdfNode` -> `fromRdfResource` and `toRdfNode` -> `toRdfResource`. Hopefully this was the last wrong usage of the term "node"

## [0.5.0] - 2025-05-20

### Changed

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed `IriNodeMapper` to `GlobalResourceMapper` and `BlankNodeMapper` to `LocalResourceMapper` for more clarity, since those do not map the identifier (aka Node) but the entire resource (aka the collection of triples with the same subject).
