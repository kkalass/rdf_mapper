/// 1. When attempting to deserialize to a specific Dart type but no deserializer is registered for it
/// 2. When encountering an RDF type IRI (from an rdf:type predicate) that has no registered deserializer
///
/// The exception contains information about which deserializer type was sought (e.g., GlobalResourceDeserializer)
/// and the target type that couldn't be handled.
