/// Core service for mapping between Dart objects and RDF representations.
///
/// The RdfMapperService handles the complete workflow of serializing and deserializing
/// domain objects to and from RDF graphs. It acts as the central coordinator in the
/// mapping process, delegating to registered mappers and managing the serialization
/// and deserialization contexts.
///
/// This service is the bridge between the higher-level API (like RdfMapper) and
/// the actual implementation of the mapping operations. It encapsulates the core
/// mapping logic while depending on the registry for mapper resolution.
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Creating appropriate serialization/deserialization contexts
/// - Managing the temporary registration of mappers
/// - Handling special cases like multi-object serialization
/// - Implementing the type resolution strategy
/// - Error handling during the mapping process
///
/// While this class can be used directly, it's typically accessed through the
/// higher-level abstractions like RdfMapper and GraphOperations.
final class RdfMapperService {
  final RdfMapperRegistry _registry;

  /// The service requires a registry that contains the mappers needed for

  /// [registry] The registry containing mappers for different types

  /// Deserializes an object of type [T] from an RDF graph, using a specific subject.
  ///
  /// This method deserializes a single object from an RDF graph, identified by
  /// the specified subject. This is useful when working with graphs that contain
  /// multiple subjects and you need to target a specific one.
  ///
  /// The deserialization process:
  /// 1. Creates a deserialization context with the provided graph
  /// 2. Looks up the appropriate deserializer for type T
  /// 3. Uses the deserializer to convert the RDF subject to a Dart object
  ///
  /// Optionally, a [register] callback can be provided to temporarily register
  /// custom mappers for this operation. The callback receives a clone of the registry.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// // Deserialize a person from a specific subject
  /// final person = service.deserializeBySubject<Person>(
  ///   graph,
  ///   IriTerm('http://example.org/people/john'),
  ///   register: (registry) {
  ///     registry.registerMapper(AddressMapper());
  ///   }
  /// );
  /// ```

  /// * [graph] - The RDF graph containing the data
  /// * [rdfSubject] - The subject identifier to deserialize
  /// * [register] - Optional callback to register temporary mappers
  /// * [completeness] - Controls how incomplete deserialization is handled:
  ///   - [CompletenessMode.strict] (default): Throws [IncompleteDeserializationException] if any triples cannot be mapped
  ///   - [CompletenessMode.lenient]: Silently ignores unmapped triples (data loss may occur)
  ///   - [CompletenessMode.warnOnly]: Logs warnings for unmapped triples but continues (data loss may occur)

  /// If the graph contains no subjects or multiple subjects, an exception is thrown.
