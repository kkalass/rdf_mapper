/// Serializers convert Dart objects into RDF representations, enabling the transformation
/// of domain models into semantic web formats. This interface serves as the root
/// of the serializer hierarchy, providing a common type for all serializers.
///
/// The serializer system is divided into two main branches:
/// - [TermSerializer]: For converting objects to single RDF terms
/// - [ResourceSerializer]: For converting objects to subjects with associated triples
///
/// This serves as a semantic marker to group all serializers in the system.
/// It doesn't define any methods itself but acts as a common ancestor.
sealed class Serializer<T> {}

/// Groups those serializers that serialize a Dart object to an RDF term
/// (i.e. IriTerm or LiteralTerm) and not to a list of Triples.
///
/// Term serializers handle the conversion of Dart objects to individual RDF terms.
/// These are useful for types that naturally map to single values in RDF, such as
/// primitive types, identifiers, or simple value objects.
///
/// Term serializers are used when:
/// - The object represents a single value or identifier
/// - No additional triples are needed to represent the object
/// - The object maps directly to a standard RDF term type

///
/// Implementations convert specific Dart types to IRI terms,
/// which are used to represent resources in RDF graphs. This serializer is
/// appropriate for objects that conceptually represent identifiers or references
/// to resources.

/// - URI/URL objects
/// - Custom identifier types
/// - Enumeration values that map to standard IRIs
/// - Reference types that should be serialized as resource references

/// can only appear as objects in RDF triples (subject-predicate-object). This serializer
/// is meant to be used as part of a larger serialization process, typically within
/// a [ResourceSerializer] implementation for handling property values.

  /// This is valid for both BlankNodeTerm and IriTerm subjects, but
