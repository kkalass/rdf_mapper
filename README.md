# rdf_mapper

ORM-like mapping between plain Dart classes and RdfGraph from [`rdf_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/rdf_core).

## Overview

`rdf_mapper` provides convenient mapping between your Dart classes and RDF graphs, similar to an ORM for databases, but for RDF data using the [`rdf_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/rdf_core) library.

## Usage

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rdf_mapper:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/yourusername/rdf_mapper.git
```

Import in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:rdf_mapper/rdf_mapper.dart';
```

## Implementation

Implementation classes will be provided soon.
